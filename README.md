# Better WP Admin
*A WordPress Custom Admin Plugin for customizing the WordPress backend to be more intuitive and easier to use for casual users (e.g. better).*

WordPress' flexible nature allows for almost every part of it to be easily changed. Creating a custom WordPress Admin Panel Theme is no different. There are essentially two ways of making a WordPress Admin theme: with a Plugin or by simply changing the CSS. The Plugin method is the easier of the two methods, allowing you to install WordPress Admin Themes quickly and easily. You literally "plug it in" and it works. 

This plugin does essentially that.  It modifies the core WP Admin CSS and provides a handful of options for branding YOU (not WordPress) as well as making the admin interface just a little better (and faster) than it is out-of-the-box.

## Plugin is very much in ALPHA
This plugin is far from complete.  We've literally just written the readme file.  

Eventually, we'll release this on GitHub and later, perhaps, on the WordPress repo.  For now, it's just an experiment.  Can we do a better job than the wonderful contributers at WordPress?  Well, we'd love to find out!

Stay tuned.
